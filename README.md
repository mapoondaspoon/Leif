# Closing this project
> Hi, this is Shie1, I created this app. I lost all motivation for this project (basically all of my projects) and I don't find myself able to continue doing this. The app is flawed in a lot of ways: It's slow, autoplay doesn't work properly, songs don't load 60% of the time, playlist ordering is awful and the database structure doesn't allow removing a song from a playlist. I can't even change any of these because my code is awful. I've rewritten this application 4 different times from scratch and I still can't manage to do it properly, I give up. I still don't know enough for a massive project like this. I hope that someone more competent than me takes this idea and makes something usable out of it. I should probably apologize to the 10 or so people who used this app. (btw I can't even use this shit, how do you guys do it?)

The Ossia Music Player is a free, open source alternative to YouTube Music, it uses the Piped API to search across video streams.
The app is able to recognize songs and collect their metadata using video data and the Content ID system. Users can log in, which allows them to create playlists.
